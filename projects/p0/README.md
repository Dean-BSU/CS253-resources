## Overview

Concisely explain what the program does. If this exceeds a couple of
sentences, you're going too far. Generally you should be pulling this
right from the project specification. I don't want you to just cut and
paste, but paraphrase what is stated in the project specification.

## Personal Goal

Creating goals for your future achievement is an important component
of human motivation and satisfaction. Create a one or two sentence goal for 
yourself in CS253 this semester to help motivate you!

Here are some examples to help you get started brainstorming.

* Understand what on earth ```char **argv``` means.
* Complete each project!
* Master low level computer programming!
* Submit a project with no memory leaks!
* I just want to pass!

## Results 

This section presents timing and other results of the experiments that 
you were asked to perform as part of the project.

## Sources used

If you used any sources outside of the lecture notes, class lab files,
or text book you need to list them here. If you looked something up on
stackoverflow.com and fail to cite it in this section it will be
considered plagiarism and be dealt with accordingly. So be safe CITE!
